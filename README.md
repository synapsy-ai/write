## Using Dev Containers for Local Development

To facilitate a consistent development environment, the Synapsy Write project includes support for development containers. This allows you to quickly set up a fully functional development environment with all necessary dependencies and tools.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) (to run containers)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (for a powerful code editor)
- [Remote - Containers extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

### Setting Up the Dev Container

Follow these steps to set up and use the development container:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/synapsy-ai/write.git
   cd write
   ```

2. **Open the Project in VS Code**:

   - Open Visual Studio Code.
   - Use the `File > Open Folder...` menu to open the `write` folder you just cloned.

3. **Open the Dev Container**:

   - Open the Command Palette (F1) and select `Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container...`.
   - Select the root folder of your project (`write`).

4. **Wait for the Container to Build**:

   - VS Code will automatically build the development container using the configuration in the `.devcontainer` folder.
   - This may take a few minutes the first time as it installs all necessary dependencies.

5. **Start Developing**:
   - Once the container is ready, you can start coding immediately.
   - The container comes pre-installed with necessary extensions such as Prettier and Tailwind CSS IntelliSense.
